Tasks for Reusing Translation Implementation:

1. **Identify Reusable Components:**
   - Review the existing translation quiz implementation.
   - Identify components and logic that can be reused for the spelling quiz.
   - Document the identified components and logic for reference.

2. **Abstract Common Logic:**
   - Refactor common logic into reusable functions or classes.
   - Ensure that the refactored code is generic enough to be used for both translation and spelling quizzes.

3. **Integrate Spelling Quiz:**
   - Use the refactored components to implement the spelling quiz.
   - Ensure that the spelling quiz follows the same flow as the translation quiz.

4. **Update UI:**
   - Modify the UI to support both translation and spelling quizzes.
   - Ensure that the UI components are reusable and adaptable for both quiz types.

5. **Testing:**
   - Test the spelling quiz to ensure it works correctly with the reused components.
   - Perform regression testing on the translation quiz to ensure no functionality is broken.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Update documentation to reflect the changes and the new spelling quiz implementation.
   - Ensure that the documentation covers both translation and spelling quizzes.
